# SMS Spam Classifier

This project is a simple SMS Spam Classifier that helps determine whether a given message is spam or not. It utilizes natural language processing techniques and a machine learning model to make predictions.
The primary goal of this project is to classify SMS messages into two categories: "Spam" or "Not Spam." It uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on a dataset of labeled messages.

## How it Works

1. **Input:** Users can input a text message into the system.
2. **Processing:** The text message undergoes preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and vectorization.
3. **Prediction:** The machine learning model predicts whether the message is spam or not.
4. **Output:** The result is displayed, indicating whether the message is classified as "Spam" or "Not Spam."
